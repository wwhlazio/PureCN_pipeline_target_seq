We have target sequencing datasets for a group of samples. We want to collect the tumor purity information. The issue is that we don't have the matched normal sample. We found a package 'PureCN' which claims can infer tumor purity without matched control (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/devel/bioc/vignettes/PureCN/inst/doc/Quick.html). We set an automatic pipeline to run the package on a largeset of samples starting from fastq files.
1. FastqQC is used to evluate the quality of the raw data. We found adapter contamination is a general problem
2. We run cutadpt to filter reads contaminated by adapter. At the same time we used inhouse code to filter low quality reads and totally the same reads.
3. We rerun FastqQC and found that we don't have adapter contamination issue anymore
4. We run bwa to align the reads
5. Duplicated reads are filtered
6. reads quality recalibration
7. run samtools mpileup
8. extract coverage information for CNV detection
9. run purecn to infer purity and ploidty
